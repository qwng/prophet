\description{
Increasing the number of Fourier components allows the seasonality to change
more quickly (at risk of overfitting).

Increasing the number of Fourier components allows the seasonality to change
more quickly (at risk of overfitting).

Increasing the number of Fourier components allows the seasonality to change
more quickly (at risk of overfitting). Default values for yearly and weekly
seasonalities are 10 and 3 respectively.
